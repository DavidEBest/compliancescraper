Just some terrible python scripts for extra-work 'work' work.

**scrape.py** pulls all the about.yml & README.md files from 18F repos where both exist, and throw them into some sub directories.

**parse.py** regexes all img links in the README files (markdown & html format) and formats them for copy and pasting into the about.yml files.
